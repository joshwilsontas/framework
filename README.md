# framework

Welcome to the Lite-Framework.

A simple but easy version of a MVC (Modal, View, Controller) Framework like Laravel and CodeIgnitor.

It is simple to use and all you have to do is play around witht he files and get your project working.

I will be adding to it over time as i learn on how to make things alot easier to use.
